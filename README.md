Integrating AngularJS and D3: A Quick Example

This is an example of how to create a bar chart using AngularJS and D3.js. 
The sample was created in response to this stackoverflow question:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27309503/how-to-inject-d3-d3plus-together-in-angular-webapp/27311108#27311108

The solution present is quite simple and only contains 3 files, the index.html, the app.js and the stylesheet file.

Enjoy!
